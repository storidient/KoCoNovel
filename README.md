## Corpus
The corpus is drawn from the public domain texts on [Wikisource](https://ko.wikisource.org/wiki/). The preprocessing involved correcting typos and incorrect line breaks within the text, and adjusting the spelling to match modern Korean grammar. The list of novels can be found in the file `list_of_novels.csv`.

## Data and Annotation
KoCoNovel contains grammatically corrected versions of novels and annotations for character coreference in four types of options, along with speaker annotations for all direct quotations. The types of options are as follows:

- **[Reader/Omniscient]** From the perspective of the omniscient author or the readers
- **[Separate/Overlapped]** How multiple entities are treated either as separate entities (e.g., [‘We’], [‘I’], [‘You’]) or as overlapped entities (e.g., [‘We’, ‘I’], [‘We’, ‘You’])
