# Corpus
The corpus is drawn from the public domain texts on Project Gutenberg, and includes individual works of fiction (both novels and short stories) that include a mix of high literary style (e.g., Edith Wharton's *Age of Innocence*, James Joyce's *Ulysses*) and popular pulp fiction (e.g., H. Rider Haggard's *King Solomon's Mines*, Horatio Alger's *Ragged Dick*).  We select approximately 2,000 words from each of 100 texts; the total annotated dataset contains 210,532 tokens.
